                                 - CSS splits up different sections of the code into modules

                                 - There are new ways you can write CSS rules with a bunch of CSS selectors

                                 - There is no backward compatibility with CSS2

                                 - With CSS2 only web safe fonts can be used

                                 - With CSS2 the concept of simple selectors were present

                                 - CSS 2 Doesn't support the Border-Box property



                                                 {.CSS3.}
                                                 ========


                                 - Both CSS and HTML were put into a single file, there was no concept of modules before.

                                 - There were no new ways of writing the CSS rules.

                                 - There is backward compatibility maintained with CSS 3

                                 - With CSS3 special fonts can be used such as those in Google Fonts and TypeCast

                                 - With CSS3 the selectors were called as a sequence of simple seletorscom

                                 - CSS3 supports the Border-Box property

                                                                - body {background-color: rgb(201, 76, 76);}

                                              
                                              =: Specify the background color with an RGBA value:

                                                                - body {background-color: rgba(201, 76, 76, 0.3);}

==================================================================================================================================================

(7).How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?



                            Background-repeat:  repeat

                                                
                                             - To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the
                                               background-repeat property.

                                             - You can use repeat value for the background-repeat property if
                                               you do want to repeat an image
  
                            Example:


                                             <html>

                                             <head>

                                                   <style>

                                                         body {

                                                                 background-repeat: repeat;

                                                                             }

                                                   </style>

                                             </head>

                                             <body>

                                             </body>

                                             </html>

==================================================================================================================================================

(8).What is the use of the background-position property? 


                                    - The background-position property sets the starting position of a background 
                                      image.


                             example:

                                     body {

                                           background-image: url('w3css5.gif');

                                           background-repeat: repeat;

                                           background-attachment: fixed;

                                           background-position: right buttom ;

                                                }

==================================================================================================================================================

(9).  Which property controls the image scroll in the background?



                       Background-Attachment Property :

                            

                                           - The background-attachment property in CSS is used to specify the kind
                                             of attachment of the background image with respect to its container.

                                           - It can be set to scroll or make it remain fixed. It can be applied to
                                             all HTML elements.
                                          



                                Syntax:
 


                                           - background-attachment: scroll;
  
                                           - background-attachment: fixed;

==================================================================================================================================================

(10). Why should background and color be used as separate properties?



                                             - Separating background and color as independent properties allows 
                                               for more flexibility and control in styling elements within a user
                                               interface or a web page.

                                             - The background refers to the area behind an element,  such as the 
                                               background color or an image applied to it, while the color refers
                                               to the foreground color of the text or the element itself. 

                                             - By keeping them separate, you can easily distinguish between the two
                                               and apply distinct styles to each, ensuring good visual contrast and
                                              cccc readability.

(11).  How to center block elements using CSS1?



                          Step 1: Define the external width


                                              - We need to define the external width.

                                              - Block-level elements have the default width of 100% of the webpage, so
                                                for centering the block element, we need space around it.

                                              - So for generating the space, we are giving it a width.


                          Step 2: Set the left-margin and the right-margin of the element to auto

                                        
                                              - Since we produced a remaining space by providing external width so now we
                                                need to align that space properly that’s why we should use margin property.

                                              - Margin is a property that tells how to align a remaining space.

                                              - So for centering the element you must set left-margin to auto and right-margin 
                                                to auto.


                                 Example:

                                        element {

                                               width:200px;

                                               margin: auto;

                                                 }

(12). How to maintain the CSS specifications?


                                              - The Specification defines how CSS properties should be implemented by browser vendors
                                                along with detailed algorithms, code samples and tabular information.

                                              - Comment your CSS code to explain its purpose, usage, and any dependencies.

                                              - This documentation helps other developers understand and maintain the codebase in the future.

                                              - Maintain a consistent coding style and naming conventions throughout your CSS
                                                codebase.Consistency helps in readability, collaboration, and easier maintenance.

                                            - With embedded style sheets, CSS rules are placed within the <style> tags in the
                                              <head> section of an HTML document.

                                            - This allows the style definitions to be specific to that particular document, as 
                                              opposed to applying styles globally across multiple pages.

                                           - When using an external style sheet, you create a separate file with a .css extension 
                                             that contains CSS code.

                                           - To link an external style sheet to an HTML document, you need to include a <link> 
                                             element in the <head> section of the HTML document.

                                           - The <link> element specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the external 
                                             style sheet.
