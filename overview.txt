(1). what is software ? what is software engineering ?


                             - SOFTWARE : software is a set of instructiones,data or programs used to
                               operate computers and execute specific tasks.
 
                             - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING : software engineering is the process of designing , developing 
                               testing, and maintaining  software.

(2). explain types of software.

                             ( system )
                       
                                  - general-purpose software that manages basic system resources and processes
                                    
                                  - runs any time the computer is on

                                  - written in low-level assembly language or machine code 

                                  - must meet specific hardware needs interacts closly with hardware
 
                                  - is necessary for the system to function 


                             ( application )

                                  - isn't needed for the system to function 

                                  - software that performs specific tasks to meet user needs 

                                  - wrriten in higher-level languages , such as python and javascript 

                                  - needs system software to run 

                                  - user or admin installs software when needed

                                  - user triggers and stops the prpogram

(3). what is sdlc ? explain each phase of sdlc.

                                 - sdlc is the cost-effective and time-efficent process that
                                   devlopment teams use to design and bulid high-quality software


                             (6 stage)
                               
                                 (1) Planning And Requirement Analysis:

                                       - Planning is the crucial step in everything and so as in 
                                         software development. In this same stage, requirement 
                                         analysis is also performed by the developers of the
                                         organization. This is attained from the inputs from the 
                                         customers, sales department/market surveys.

                                       - The information from this analysis forms the building block 
                                         of a basic project. The quality proof of the project is a result
                                         of planning. Thus, in this stage, the basic project is designed 
                                         with all the available information.

                                 (2) Defining Requirements:

                                       - In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are
                                         specified. These requirements get approval from the customers,
                                         market analysts, and stakeholders.

                                 (3) Designing Architecture:

                                       -  SRS is a reference for software designers to come out with the 
                                          best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements
                                          defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are
                                          present in the Design Document Specification (DDS).

                                       - This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating
                                         all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen 
                                         for the development.

                                 (4) Developing Product:

                                       - At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this,
                                         developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS.
                                         Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the
                                         association.

                                       - Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. 

                                 (5) Product Testing and Integration:

                                       - After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary
                                         to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at
                                         every stage of SDLC.

                                 (6) Deployment and Maintenance Of Product:

                                       - If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole.
                                         After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is
                                         or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers.
                                         However, this alone is not enough. Therefore, along with the deployment, 
                                         the product’s supervision.

(4).What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on flipcart.

                                
                                  - DFD is the abbreviation for Data Flow Diagram. The flow of data of a system or
                                    a process is represented by DFD.

                                  - It also gives insight into the inputs and outputs of each entity and the process 
                                    itself.

                                  - DFD does not have control flow and no loops or decision rules are present.

                                  - Specific operations depending on the type of data can be explained by a flowchart.

                                  - It is a graphical tool, useful for communicating with users ,managers and other
                                    personnel.

                                  - It is useful for analysing existing as well as proposed system.

(5).What is Flow chart? Create a flowchart to make addition of two numbers.

                                  -  Flowcharts are nothing but the graphical representation of the data or the
                                     algorithm for a better understanding of the code visually.

                                  - It displays step-by-step solutions to a problem, algorithm, or process. It 
                                    is a pictorial way of representing steps that are preferred by most beginner-
                                    level programmers to understand algorithms of computer science, thus it
                                    contributes to troubleshooting the issues in the algorithm.

                                  - A flowchart is a picture of boxes that indicates the process flow in a
                                    sequential manner.

                                  - Since a flowchart is a pictorial representation of a process or algorithm,
                                    it’s easy to interpret and understand the process.

(6). What is Use case Diagram? Create a use-case on bill payment on paytm.

                                  - A use case diagram is a visual summarization of interactions and relationships
                                    within a system. These diagrams show a very broad view of a system. They may 
                                    show systems in computer software, businesses or customer experiences. 

                                  - A use case diagram shows a model scenario in which individuals interact with
                                    a system using a series of specialized symbols and connectors.
